# My build of suckless's dwm

This is my build of [suckless](https://suckless.org)'s [dwm](https://dwm.suckless.org).

# Patches

patches directory contains all the patches applied to this build. Other than
that there are my own modifications to some parts of the source code. To know
more about the changes you can view the git logs. To be honest that git log is
a mess, my modification and the modification done by the patches are all all
together in single big commit. Because I didn't even know how to even use git
back then, when I was playing with dwm.
